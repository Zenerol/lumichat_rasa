      I’m really sorry you’re feeling sad right now. It’s okay to have those moments—feelings like that mean you’ve been trying hard.
      You don’t have to rush yourself; little by little, things can get lighter again.

  utter_mood_happy/p0001:
  - text: >
      That’s so nice to hear! You deserve moments like this—simple, calm, and happy.

      Feeling anxious all the time can be exhausting. It’s like your mind never gives you a moment to breathe.
      Your unease is valid—carrying constant tension doesn’t mean you’re weak, it means you’ve been under pressure for too long.


  utter_anxiety/p0002:
    - text: |
        It’s normal to worry, and constant worrying can drain your energy. Set a five-minute timer,
        list the exact worries in a notebook, and beside each one write a next small step you can actually do.
        Close the notebook when the timer ends and switch to a short, calming activity.

  utter_anxiety/p0003:
    - text: |
        Pre-presentation nerves are common. Practice box breathing: 
        inhale 4 counts, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4—repeat for one to two minutes. 
        Pair this with a quick run-through of your opening lines to build calm and momentum.

  utter_anxiety/p0004:
    - text: |
        That racing-heart feeling is a typical anxiety response. Plant your feet flat on the floor, 
        press your toes gently, and notice the pressure shifting from heels to toes for one minute. 
        Match that focus with slow exhales that are slightly longer than your inhales.

  utter_anxiety/p0005:
    - text: |
        When anxiety swells, a brief mindfulness check-in can help. Sit comfortably, 
        notice the sensation of air at the tip of your nose, and count ten natural breaths. 
        If your mind wanders, simply bring it back to breath without judgment.

  utter_anxiety/p0006:
    - text: |
        Tension without a clear cause can still be eased. Roll your shoulders back and down ten times, 
        gently stretch your neck side to side, and take a two-minute walk if possible. 
        Hydrate afterward to support your body’s reset.

  utter_anxiety/p0007:
    - text: |
        Test anxiety is common and manageable. Create a mini checklist of three topics to review, 
        spend focused 15-minute blocks on each, and take two-minute breathing breaks between blocks. 
        On exam day, do three rounds of slow box breathing before you begin.

  utter_anxiety/p0008:
    - text: |
        Catastrophic thoughts can snowball quickly. 
        Write the thought, then list evidence for and against it, 
        and finish with the most likely outcome in one sentence. 
        Keep the card and reread the balanced statement when the thought returns.

  utter_anxiety/p0009:
    - text: |
        Social anxiety can feel heavy. Prepare one or two simple openers in advance, 
        choose a small setting when possible, and give yourself a clear time limit for the event. 
        Afterward, note one thing that went okay to reinforce progress.

  utter_anxiety/p0010:
    - text: |
        Overthinking is exhausting. Schedule a daily ten-minute “worry window,” let your mind list concerns, then close it and shift to a brief absorbing task like a short walk or tidying a small space. Consistency trains your brain to postpone rumination.

  utter_anxiety/p0011:
    - text: |
        Worries about the future are common. Pick one small, doable goal for today, write the next two steps, and start the first step within five minutes. Small actions reduce uncertainty and rebuild a sense of control.

  utter_anxiety/p0012:
    - text: |
        Anxiety can show up in the body as nausea or lightheadedness. Sip water slowly, place a cool object against your palm, and practice gentle belly breathing: hand on stomach, inhale to lift your hand, exhale to lower it. Give yourself a calm five-minute window.

  utter_anxiety/p0013:
    - text: |
        When your mind derails, use a quick reset. Count backward from 10 to 1 with steady breaths, then describe one nearby object using color, shape, and texture. This brief focus helps your attention come back online.

  utter_anxiety/p0014:
    - text: |
        Nighttime worries like to get louder. Do a two-minute brain dump in a notebook, then try progressive muscle relaxation: starting at your toes, gently tense for five seconds and release, moving up through legs, torso, and face. Keep lights dim and screens away while you wind down.

  utter_anxiety/p0015:
    - text: |
        Feeling weighed down is understandable. Schedule one short pleasant activity—music, stretching, or a brief chat with a trusted friend—and give it a clear start and end time. Small doses of positive engagement help nudge mood upward.

  utter_anxiety/p0016:
    - text: |
        Chest tightness often accompanies anxiety. Practice a few rounds of box breathing (4-4-4-4) and gently place a hand on your chest to track slower exhales. Stand and roll your shoulders to release residual tension.

  utter_anxiety/p0017:
    - text: |
        Mental replays can be persistent. Write the situation in three sentences, add a compassionate note you would give a friend, and close with one learning you’re taking forward. Revisit this summary when the replay starts.

  utter_anxiety/p0018:
    - text: |
        Racing thoughts respond to a firm pause. Say “stop” in your mind, then shift to a one-minute focus on the feeling of air as you exhale. Follow it with a simple, concrete task like organizing three items on your desk.

  utter_anxiety/p0019:
    - text: |
        Anxiety can surface even during good times. Try a brief gratitude note with three specific items from today, then do a 1–2 minute grounding scan: feet on floor, seat on chair, breath in and out. This anchors attention in what’s here now.

  utter_anxiety/p0020:
    - text: |
        Fear of disappointing others can be heavy. Write your feelings in a private letter you won’t send, then identify one boundary or realistic expectation you can set this week. Keep the letter as a reminder that your needs also matter.

  utter_anxiety/p0021:
    - text: |
        Persistent anxiety can drain your energy. Try progressive muscle relaxation: tense each muscle group for five seconds, then release slowly from head to toe. Doing this for five minutes can signal safety to your nervous system.

  utter_anxiety/p0022:
    - text: |
        Shortness of breath is a common anxiety symptom. Use the 4-7-8 breathing method: inhale through your nose for 4, hold for 7, exhale through your mouth for 8. Repeat this cycle four times to stabilize your breath.

  utter_anxiety/p0023:
    - text: |
        Repetitive checking is a way of coping with uncertainty. Create a checklist, say out loud what you’ve already done, and then set the list aside. With practice, your mind learns to trust that the task is complete.

  utter_anxiety/p0024:
    - text: |
        Social anxiety is real and valid. Start by joining smaller gatherings, and bring along a supportive friend if you can. Gradual exposure builds confidence without overwhelming you.

  utter_anxiety/p0025:
    - text: |
        Physical “butterflies” in the stomach are common signs of anxiety. Close your eyes, picture a successful outcome, and replay it a few times. Visualization helps shift nervous energy into motivation.

  utter_anxiety/p0026:
    - text: |
        Fidgeting releases nervous energy. Channel it into something useful like squeezing a stress ball, stretching your arms, or taking a short walk. These actions let the body discharge tension safely.

  utter_anxiety/p0027:
    - text: |
        Anxiety often makes us self-conscious. Remind yourself gently that most people are focused on themselves, not on you. Practice self-kindness by affirming one thing you value about yourself today.

  utter_anxiety/p0028:
    - text: |
        Heart palpitations can feel alarming but are a natural anxiety response. Slow your breathing and place your hand gently on your chest while counting each beat. This steady focus helps your heart settle.

  utter_anxiety/p0029:
    - text: |
        A daily “worry time” can reduce intrusive thoughts. Schedule a fixed ten minutes to write down concerns, then deliberately move on to a pleasant activity. Training your brain this way reduces the urge to ruminate all day.

  utter_anxiety/p0030:
    - text: |
        Headaches are often linked with anxiety and tension. Take regular breaks from screens, sip water slowly, and do gentle neck stretches. Pair this with steady breathing to ease both body and mind.

  utter_anxiety/p0031:
    - text: |
        The fear of making mistakes is very common. Practice positive self-talk such as, “Mistakes help me learn.” Remind yourself that nobody performs perfectly all the time.

  utter_anxiety/p0032:
    - text: |
        Crowded places can feel overwhelming. Plan ahead by noting quiet spots where you can take a break and carry headphones or calming music. Knowing your escape plan reduces the sense of being trapped.

  utter_anxiety/p0033:
    - text: |
        Anxiety can affect appetite. Try mindful eating—notice flavors, textures, and pace yourself slowly. Keeping a simple food and mood journal may help you spot patterns and restore balance.

  utter_anxiety/p0034:
    - text: |
        Decision-making feels harder with anxiety. Limit your choices to two or three options, and remind yourself that most decisions aren’t permanent. This lightens the pressure and makes choices more manageable.

  utter_anxiety/p0035:
    - text: |
        Comparing yourself to others can fuel anxiety. Shift focus by listing three personal strengths or achievements from this week. Celebrating even small progress helps boost confidence.

  utter_anxiety/p0036:
    - text: |
        Anxiety often disrupts sleep. Establish a bedtime routine like journaling, light reading, or gentle stretches before bed. A consistent routine helps calm the mind and improve rest quality.

  utter_anxiety/p0037:
    - text: |
        Anxiety can weaken self-trust. Keep a journal of positive decisions you’ve made and reread it when doubt creeps in. Over time, you’ll see evidence that you can rely on yourself.

  utter_anxiety/p0038:
    - text: |
        Grounding techniques bring you back to the present. Hold a familiar object in your hand, notice its texture and weight, or name five things you can see around you. These simple actions reset focus.

  utter_anxiety/p0039:
    - text: |
        Negative “what if” thoughts can feel endless. Write down the thought, then challenge it with facts and real evidence. Replace it with a balanced statement to help break the cycle.

  utter_anxiety/p0040:
    - text: |
        Anxiety can cause nausea and stomach discomfort. Sip cool water, place your hand on your stomach, and breathe so your belly rises and falls gently. Pair this with a few slow exhales to ease the sensation.

  utter_anxiety/p0041:
    - text: |

  utter_anxiety/p0042:
    - text: |

  utter_anxiety/p0043:
    - text: |
        Forgetfulness can increase during anxious moments. Keep a small notepad or use your phone for quick notes and reminders. This helps your mind relax, knowing the information is safe.

  utter_anxiety/p0044:
    - text: |
        Loud noises can trigger anxiety. Pause, take slow breaths, and picture yourself in a calm, safe place. If possible, use headphones or earplugs to reduce the impact of sound.

  utter_anxiety/p0045:
    - text: |

  utter_anxiety/p0046:

  utter_anxiety/p0047:
    - text: |
        Reaching out for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Support systems exist to guide you, and everyone needs help at times. Accepting support lightens the weight of anxiety.

  utter_anxiety/p0048:

    - text: |

  utter_anxiety/p0058:
    - text: |
        Dwelling on the past can fuel anxiety. Mindfulness—focusing only on the current activity—helps reduce rumination. Practice by giving your full attention to a simple task like washing your hands or eating slowly.

  utter_anxiety/p0059:
    - text: |

  utter_depression/p0001:
  - text: Feeling empty can be a very lonely experience, and it’s a common part of
      depression. It may help to gently reconnect with your senses—listening to music,
      smelling something pleasant, or holding something soft can ground you in the
      present. These small sensory moments can slowly help you feel more connected,
      even when emotions are hard to find. Please know your feelings matter, even
      when you feel numb.
  utter_depression/p0002:
  - text: Trouble concentrating is something many people experience with depression.
      You might try studying in short bursts and taking frequent breaks to avoid feeling
      overwhelmed. Even if your progress feels slow, every bit of effort is meaningful.
      Give yourself credit for anything you’re able to do today, and know that you’re
      not alone in facing these challenges.
  utter_depression/p0003:
  - text: Feeling worthless is a painful symptom of depression, and it’s not a reflection
      of your true value. Try writing down a few things you’ve accomplished or positive
      qualities others have noticed about you, no matter how small. Reading these
      when you feel low can help you remember that you have worth, even when your
      mind says otherwise.
  utter_depression/p0004:
  - text: Academic struggles are very common when you’re feeling depressed. It can
      help to break assignments into smaller, more manageable tasks and reach out
      to your teachers for support if possible. Remember, your health and well-being
      come first, and asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.
  utter_depression/p0005:
  - text: Losing interest in everything can make life feel dull and exhausting. When
      this happens, try to keep a simple daily routine, even if it’s just waking up,
      eating, and getting dressed. Routines help anchor your days and can gently remind
      you that you’re still moving forward, even when motivation is low.

  - text: Emotional numbness is a common way your mind tries to protect you from pain.
      Even though it feels uncomfortable, this numbness is temporary. Engaging your
      senses with simple experiences, like holding a warm mug or listening to your
      favorite song, can help bring small moments of comfort and connection.
  utter_depression/p0007:
  - text: Opening up about your feelings can be difficult, but you’re not alone in
      this. Sometimes writing down what you want to say beforehand or expressing yourself
      through art or music can help you process and share your emotions. Remember,
      reaching out is a strong and courageous step toward healing.
  utter_depression/p0008:
  - text: These painful thoughts are a symptom of depression, not a reflection of
      reality. Try to recall times when your friends valued your company, or moments
      when you supported them. You are an important part of other people’s lives,
      even when it’s hard to see your own worth. Please remember that your presence
      matters.
  utter_depression/p0009:
  - text: Sleeping a lot during the day is a common sign of depression. Try setting
      gentle alarms to wake up after short naps and spend some time by a window or
      in natural light. Adjusting your sleep routine slowly can help restore your
      energy and support a more balanced mood.
  utter_depression/p0010:
  - text: Depression often makes self-care feel impossible. Breaking tasks into tiny
      steps—like sitting up, moving to the bathroom, or having a small snack—can make
      things more manageable. Celebrate every effort, and remember that your needs
      are important, no matter how small the steps seem.
  utter_depression/p0011:
  - text: Wanting to stay inside is common with depression. Even small actions, like
      opening a window or stepping outside for a minute, can help you gently reconnect
      with the world. Over time, these small steps can bring a sense of renewal and
      comfort.
  utter_depression/p0012:
  - text: Depression can make it feel like you’re standing still. Trying one new,
      small activity each day—like listening to a new song or changing your usual
      routine—can help you notice progress, even if it’s slow. Every small step forward
      matters and shows your resilience.
  utter_depression/p0013:
  - text: Irritability is a real symptom of depression, not a sign that you’re a bad
      person. When you notice yourself becoming upset, pausing for a moment to take
      a few deep breaths can help you regain control. Practicing patience and self-forgiveness
      is important—everyone has hard days.
  utter_depression/p0014:
  - text: Hopelessness can be one of the toughest feelings depression brings. On these
      days, try focusing on just one meaningful or enjoyable activity, no matter how
      small. Even a short walk, a favorite snack, or a simple pleasure can make a
      difference and remind you that your feelings can change.
  utter_depression/p0015:
  - text: Indecisiveness is a common struggle with depression. Try writing down your
      options and considering the pros and cons of each, even for minor decisions.
      This can help make choices feel less overwhelming, and over time, your confidence
      in making decisions can grow.
  utter_depression/p0016:
  - text: Withdrawing from loved ones can be a natural response to depression, but
      it often leads to more isolation. Try sending a short message or just being
      present in the same room with someone you trust. Keeping a small connection
      can help you feel less alone.
  utter_depression/p0017:
  - text: Unexplained aches and pains are common with depression. Gentle stretching,
      a warm shower, or using a heating pad can provide comfort. Taking care of your
      body is an important part of emotional healing as well.
  utter_depression/p0018:
  - text: Losing motivation for schoolwork is understandable when you’re feeling down.
      Focusing on starting with just one small part of a task, instead of the whole,
      can make things less overwhelming and help you regain a sense of accomplishment.
  utter_depression/p0019:
  - text: When small tasks feel huge, try breaking them into single steps and giving
      yourself credit for each accomplishment. Remind yourself that your pace is okay
      and that any progress is a victory.
  utter_depression/p0020:
  - text: Excessive guilt is a painful part of depression. Practicing self-forgiveness
      and remembering that everyone makes mistakes can help ease this burden. Be gentle
      with yourself and recognize that your feelings are not always facts.
  utter_depression/p0021:
  - text: Loss of appetite is common in depression. Try to have small, frequent snacks
      or drinks throughout the day to support your body’s needs. Even eating a little
      is a positive step.
  utter_depression/p0022:
  - text: Emotional eating is a common response to sadness. Try to choose nourishing
      snacks and eat mindfully, noticing how different foods make you feel. Being
      kind to yourself during these moments is just as important as making healthy
      choices.
  utter_depression/p0023:
  - text: Anxiety and sadness often go hand in hand. Practicing slow, deep breathing
      or grounding techniques, like naming things you see or hear around you, can
      help you feel more steady and in control.
  utter_depression/p0024:
  - text: Psychomotor slowing is a real symptom of depression. Try gentle movements,
      like stretching or a short walk, to encourage your body and mind to re-engage.
      Small physical actions can help you feel a little more awake and present.
  utter_depression/p0025:
  - text: It takes a lot of energy to hide your struggles. Giving yourself permission
      to be honest with at least one person you trust, or expressing your feelings
      in a journal, can bring relief and reduce the weight of pretending.
  utter_depression/p0026:
  - text: Feeling stuck and hopeless is a heavy burden. Recovery can take time, but
      it is possible. Celebrate even the smallest improvements, and remind yourself
      that change, no matter how slow, is real and meaningful.
  utter_depression/p0027:
  - text: Emotional isolation is tough, even in a crowd. Gently joining group activities,
      or simply being near others, can help you reconnect over time, even if you don’t
      feel like talking.
  utter_depression/p0028:
  - text: Losing interest quickly is common. Using timers for short work periods with
      breaks can make tasks more manageable. Completing small sections is still real
      progress.
  utter_depression/p0029:
  - text: Negative self-image is a painful part of depression. Try to focus on small
      acts of self-care or write down qualities you appreciate about yourself, even
      if they’re not about appearance. Your value goes beyond looks.
  utter_depression/p0030:
  - text: Physical symptoms can be linked to emotional distress. Relaxation techniques,
      like deep breathing and gentle stretching, may help ease discomfort. Taking
      care of your body supports your mind, too.
  utter_depression/p0031:
  - text: Losing interest in planning is a natural part of depression. Focusing on
      just one day at a time and setting small, achievable goals can help you regain
      a sense of purpose.
  utter_depression/p0032:
  - text: This is a common way people protect themselves during depression. Remind
      yourself that it’s okay to accept support, and reaching out, even a little,
      is an act of courage.
  utter_depression/p0033:
  - text: Frequent tears are a sign of emotional overwhelm. Gentle activities, like
      listening to soothing music or taking a warm bath, can help provide comfort
      when feelings are intense.
  utter_depression/p0034:
  - text: Memory problems can be part of depression. Writing reminders or using notes
      on your phone can help you keep track of tasks and reduce frustration.
  utter_depression/p0035:
  - text: Emotional swings are common. If you feel upset, give yourself a break before
      reacting and practice self-forgiveness. Finding healthy outlets, like drawing
      or walking, can also help manage anger.
  utter_depression/p0036:
  - text: Depression can make you feel like a different person. Looking at old photos,
      recalling happy memories, or talking with someone who knows you well can help
      you reconnect with your true self.
  utter_depression/p0037:
  - text: Sharing your struggles is a vulnerable step. Remember, you deserve support,
      and speaking up is a sign of bravery. You are not alone, and people do care
      about your well-being.
  utter_depression/p0038:
  - text: Sleep issues often go hand in hand with depression. Creating a calming bedtime
      routine—dimming lights, listening to soft music, or reading—can help signal
      to your body that it’s time to rest.
  utter_depression/p0039:
  - text: Feeling overwhelmed and wanting to give up is a sign you need support. Break
      your day into small, manageable tasks, and acknowledge each accomplishment,
      no matter how minor it feels. Remember, you are not alone and support is available.
  utter_depression/p0040:
  - text: I’m truly sorry you’re feeling this way. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed
      when sadness doesn’t seem to go away. Many people experience this, and it’s
      not your fault. It can help to keep a journal of your emotions, even if you
      only write a sentence or two each day. Noticing small patterns over time can
      make your feelings feel less heavy and help you see moments of hope, even when
      things are tough. Please remember that what you’re feeling is valid and you
      deserve support.
  utter_depression/p0041:
  - text: You’re not alone in feeling this way. Depression can make it incredibly
      hard to start even simple tasks. Try to be kind to yourself and set just one
      small goal each day, like eating breakfast or making your bed. Each small step
      is an achievement, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now. Give yourself
      credit for every effort, and know that motivation can return gradually with
      patience and support.
  utter_depression/p0042:
  - text: It’s completely understandable to feel hopeless when depression takes hold.
      Sometimes the future can look so uncertain that it’s hard to see a way forward.
      In times like this, focusing on daily routines—such as getting enough rest,
      eating regular meals, and spending a few moments outside—can make a big difference.
      These acts of self-care are powerful reminders that you matter, even when hope
      is hard to find.
  utter_depression/p0043:
  - text: Losing interest in your favorite activities can be very discouraging. Depression
      often makes it difficult to enjoy things that once brought you happiness. Try
      to gently reintroduce yourself to those hobbies, even if only for a few minutes
      at a time. Remember, it’s okay if you don’t feel better right away. The act
      of showing up for yourself is already a sign of progress, and joy can come back
      with time and patience.
  utter_depression/p0044:
  - text: Fatigue is a common and exhausting part of depression. It’s not laziness
      or weakness—it’s a real symptom that many people experience. Maintaining a regular
      sleep schedule, and allowing yourself to rest when needed, is important. Even
      gentle movements, like stretching or taking a short walk, can help your body
      recharge. Your efforts, no matter how small, are enough for today.
  utter_depression/p0045:
  - text: It can be so discouraging when nothing seems to bring happiness. Depression
      has a way of numbing our feelings and making good moments hard to notice. One
      gentle way to help is to keep a gratitude journal—just jot down a few small
      things that are okay or pleasant, even if it’s just the taste of your morning
      coffee. Over time, this practice can help you reconnect with moments of comfort
      or joy, even if they’re brief.
  utter_depression/p0046:
  - text: Wanting to be alone is a very natural response to depression, but isolation
      can sometimes make sadness stronger. It’s okay to take time for yourself, but
      try to keep some connection with people you trust, even if it’s just a short
      message or being in the same room. Small social steps are valuable and remind
      you that you’re not alone, even if it feels that way sometimes.
  utter_depression/p0047:
  - text: Tears can come unexpectedly when we’re carrying a lot inside. Allowing yourself
      to cry is a healthy way to process deep emotions. Holding something comforting,
      like a pillow or a favorite sweater, and focusing on slow, steady breaths can
      provide some calm. It’s okay to feel things deeply—your emotions matter and
      you’re allowed to express them.
  utter_depression/p0048:
  - text: It’s common for depression to make you feel like you’re a burden, but your
      feelings are not a burden and you are important to those who care about you.
      Try to remember times you’ve supported or helped others—your presence matters.
      Practicing self-kindness, like writing a compassionate letter to yourself, can
      help challenge these difficult thoughts over time. You are worthy of care and
      support.
  utter_depression/p0049:
  - text: 'On days when getting out of bed feels impossible, know that you’re not
      alone and that small actions are achievements. Try breaking your morning down
      into tiny steps: sit up, put your feet on the floor, and drink a glass of water.
      Celebrate each small victory—no matter how minor it feels. Every effort you
      make is a sign of your strength and resilience, even if it’s just getting started.'

        Feeling drained and unmotivated doesn’t mean you’re weak. 
        Sometimes, when the mind is overwhelmed, even small things start to feel too heavy. 
        It’s normal to lose interest in the things that once made you happy when sadness lingers for a while. 
        Your body might just be asking for a slower pace and a bit of understanding. You deserve kindness, 
        even on days when you can’t do much.

  utter_depression/p0051:
  - text: 
        Feeling sad without a clear reason can be confusing. 
        Sometimes emotions build up quietly until they become heavy to carry. 
        It doesn’t always need an explanation to be valid. What you’re feeling is real, 
        and it deserves understanding and rest.

  utter_depression/p0052:
  - text: 
        Feeling unseen or forgotten can cut deeply. When loneliness lasts too long, 
        the mind starts to believe no one cares. You still matter, even if it doesn’t feel that way right now. 
        Your presence has value that can’t be replaced.

  utter_depression/p0053:
  - text: 
        Wearing a smile while hurting inside takes a lot of strength. 
        Pretending to be fine often hides how much pain you’ve been carrying. 
        You’ve been doing your best to keep it together, even if no one sees it. 
        That effort alone already shows resilience.

        Pulling away from others doesn’t mean you don’t care.

        You’ve made it through days that felt impossible before.

        Guilt often follows people who care too deeply. 
        You blame yourself because you want to do things right.

        Seeing others happy while you’re struggling can make sadness feel deeper.

        Comparing your life to polished posts drains the spirit.

  - text: Feeling lonely even in a crowd is more common than you might think. Sometimes,
      it’s not about the number of people around us, but the depth of our connections.
      Consider reaching out to a close friend or family member and sharing how you
      feel. Building meaningful connections takes time, so try engaging in activities
      or groups that genuinely interest you. Remember, you are not alone in your feelings,
      and it's okay to seek support when you need it.
  utter_loneliness/p0002:

      better as you settle in.
  utter_loneliness/p0006:
  - text: Eating alone can feel isolating, but it's also a chance for self-care. Try

      you enjoy. Building connections takes time, so be gentle with yourself as you
      navigate this season.
  utter_loneliness/p0007:

      your time finding where you belong.
  utter_loneliness/p0009:
  - text: Missing old friends is completely normal, especially after a big change.
      Try reaching out to them if you can, or look for ways to stay connected online.

  utter_loneliness/p0010:
  - text: Being an outsider can feel lonely and discouraging. Remember, you bring

        Anniversaries gather time into one sharp point. The body keeps the date even without a reminder.
        Your quiet on those days is respect for what that life means.

  utter_grief_loss/p0086:

        Half-finished tasks show how grief pauses the mind mid-step. Focus slips because your heart is busy elsewhere.
        Your incomplete work is a reflection of the load, not your ability.

  utter_grief_loss/p0092:

        Quiet visits can steady a shaken heart. Names on stone hold stories that don’t end.
        Your time by their resting place is a soft conversation without words.

        Panic in crowded rooms is grief turning into a physical wave. Breath gets small when memories get big.
        Your step outside is care for a body that needs space.

  utter_grief_loss/p0098:
  - text: >
        Invisible grief still weighs the same. Quiet pain doesn’t mean small pain.
        Your hidden heaviness is valid even when others can’t see it.

  utter_grief_loss/p0099:
  - text: >
        New memories can feel like walking ahead without a hand you used to hold. The guilt is love afraid of being left behind.
        Your hesitation is tender and human.

  utter_grief_loss/p0100:
  - text: >
        Daily grieving is exhausting in a way few things are. Carrying absence takes strength you don’t always feel.
        Your weariness makes sense—love leaves an ache that asks to be honored.
